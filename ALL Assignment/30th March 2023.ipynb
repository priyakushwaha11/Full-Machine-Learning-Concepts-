    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization\n",
    "    penalties in order to address some of the limitations of these individual techniques. The elastic net regularization\n",
    "    term is a linear combination of the L1 and L2 regularization terms. This helps to overcome issues such as\n",
    "    multicollinearity and the tendency of Lasso to select only one variable when there are highly correlated predictors.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The optimal values of the regularization parameters (alpha and l1_ratio) for Elastic Net Regression can be chosen \n",
    "    through techniques such as cross-validation. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into training and \n",
    "    validation sets multiple times, fitting the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the \n",
    "    validation set. The combination of parameters that gives the best performance (e.g., lowest mean squared error)\n",
    "    on the validation set is considered optimal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Advantages of Elastic Net Regression include its ability to handle multicollinearity, select important features\n",
    "    (like Lasso), and provide a balance between L1 and L2 regularization. Disadvantages include the need to tune\n",
    "    hyperparameters and the potential complexity in interpreting the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "AnS: Elastic Net Regression is commonly used in scenarios where there are a large number of predictors, and\n",
    "    multicollinearity is a concern. It is useful in feature selection and variable importance analysis\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:  The coefficients in Elastic Net Regression can be interpreted similarly to those in linear regression. They\n",
    "    represent the change in the response variable for a one-unit change in the predictor variable, all else being equal.\n",
    "    The L1 penalty in elastic net encourages sparsity, so some coefficients may be exactly zero, effectively excluding\n",
    "    the corresponding features.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:  Handling missing values in Elastic Net Regression involves either imputing missing values or using techniques that\n",
    "    can handle missing data, such as mean imputation or more advanced methods like K-nearest neighbors imputation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Elastic Net Regression inherently performs feature selection by assigning zero coefficients to some features.\n",
    "    Alternatively, you can explicitly use the regularization path provided by Elastic Net to identify and select\n",
    "    important features.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q8. How do you pickle and unpickle a trained Elastic Net Regression model in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Pickling and unpickling a trained Elastic Net Regression model in Python can be done using the pickle module. You\n",
    "    can use pickle.dump() to save the model to a file and pickle.load() to load the model back into memory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q9. What is the purpose of pickling a model in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:  Pickling a model in machine learning serves the purpose of saving the trained model to a file, allowing you to\n",
    "    later use or deploy the model without having to retrain it. This is particularly useful in scenarios where training\n",
    "    the model is computationally expensive or time-consuming.\n",
    "    \n"
