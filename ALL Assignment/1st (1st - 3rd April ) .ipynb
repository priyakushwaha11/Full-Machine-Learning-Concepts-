    "Q1. Explain the difference between linear regression and logistic regression models. Provide an example of\n",
    "a scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Difference between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous outcome, while logistic regression is used for predicting the \n",
    "probability of an event occurring (binary classification).\n",
    "The output of linear regression is a continuous value, whereas the output of logistic regression is a probability score \n",
    "between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the event.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: Linear regression could be used to predict a person's weight based on their height, while logistic \n",
    "        regression could be used to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on study hours.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q2. What is the cost function used in logistic regression, and how is it optimized?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Cost Function in Logistic Regression and Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function in logistic regression is the logistic loss (or cross-entropy loss).\n",
    "The goal is to minimize this cost function during training.\n",
    "Optimization is often performed using gradient descent or other optimization algorithms to find the set of parameters \n",
    "that minimizes the cost func\n",

    "Q3. Explain the concept of regularization in logistic regression and how it helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Regularization in Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function.\n",
    "It discourages overly complex models by penalizing large coefficients.\n",
    "The two common types are L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q4. What is the ROC curve, and how is it used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression\n",
    "model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:ROC Curve and its Use in Logistic Regression Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the model's ability to discriminate \n",
    "between positive and negative classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC (Area Under the Curve) is often used to quantify the performance of the model, with a higher AUC indicating better\n",
    "performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. What are some common techniques for feature selection in logistic regression? How do these\n",
    "techniques help improve the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Feature Selection Techniques in Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Common techniques include backward elimination, forward selection, and L1 regularization (Lasso).\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques help improve performance by selecting the most relevant features and avoiding overfitting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. How can you handle imbalanced datasets in logistic regression? What are some strategies for dealing\n",
    "with class imbalance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Handling Imbalanced Datasets in Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques include oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, and using synthetic data \n",
    "generation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice depends on the specific dataset and problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q7. Can you discuss some common issues and challenges that may arise when implementing logistic\n",
    "regression, and how they can be addressed? For example, what can be done if there is multicollinearity\n",
    "among the independent variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Common Issues and Challenges in Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity: When independent variables are highly correlated, it can be addressed by removing one of the \n",
    "    correlated variables or using dimensionality reduction techniques.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Outliers: Outliers can significantly impact logistic regression. Robust methods or outlier detection techniques can be\n",
    "    employed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Non-linearity: If the relationship between variables is not linear, transformations or using more complex models might \n",
