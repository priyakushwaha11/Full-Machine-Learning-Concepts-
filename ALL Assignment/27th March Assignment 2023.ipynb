    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it\n",
    "represent?\n",
    "Ans:R-squared in Linear Regression:\n",
    "R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is\n",
    "explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the\n",
    "model does not explain any variance, and 1 indicates a perfect fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  Adjusted R-squared:\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of predictors in the model.\n",
    "While R-squared tends to increase with the addition of any variable, adjusted R-squared penalizes the inclusion of \n",
    "irrelevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. When is it more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate when comparing models with different numbers of predictors. It helps to\n",
    "    avoid overestimating the goodness of fit by considering the complexity added by including more variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are RMSE, MSE, and MAE in the context of regression analysis? How are these metrics\n",
    "calculated, and what do they represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): It is the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted\n",
    "and actual values.\n",
    "MSE (Mean Squared Error): It is the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "MAE (Mean Absolute Error): It is the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in\n",
    "regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: RMSE: Sensitive to outliers, penalizes large errors heavily.\n",
    "MSE: Similar to RMSE but without the square root, which can make it easier to interpret.\n",
    "MAE: Less sensitive to outliers, but may not reflect large errors well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. Explain the concept of Lasso regularization. How does it differ from Ridge regularization, and when is\n",
    "it more appropriate to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Lasso regularization adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function based on the absolute values of the\n",
    "    coefficients. It can lead to feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively removing\n",
    "    them. Lasso differs from Ridge regularization, which uses the squared values of coefficients.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an\n",
    "example to illustrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Regularized linear models prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms to the cost function, discouraging overly \n",
    "    complex models. For example, in Lasso regularization, some coefficients become exactly zero, indicating the \n",
    "    exclusion of corresponding features.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q8. Discuss the limitations of regularized linear models and explain why they may not always be the best\n",
    "choice for regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: May remove important features: Lasso may exclude important predictors.\n",
    "Tuning parameters: Selection of regularization parameters can be challenging.\n",
    "Assumes linear relationships: Might not perform well with highly nonlinear data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q9. You are comparing the performance of two regression models using different evaluation metrics.\n",
    "Model A has an RMSE of 10, while Model B has an MAE of 8. Which model would you choose as the better\n",
    "performer, and why? Are there any limitations to your choice of metric?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Model B with MAE of 8 would be preferred because MAE is less sensitive to outliers than RMSE. Limitations include\n",
    "    MAE not penalizing large errors as much as RMSE.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q10. You are comparing the performance of two regularized linear models using different types of\n",
    "regularization. Model A uses Ridge regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.1, while Model B\n",
    "uses Lasso regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.5. Which model would you choose as the\n",
    "better performer, and why? Are there any trade-offs or limitations to your choice of regularization\n",
    "method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The choice depends on the context. If feature sparsity is desired, Lasso (Model B) might be preferred. However,\n",
    "    there are trade-offs, as Lasso can be sensitive to multicollinearity and might not work well if all features are \n",
    "    important. The choice also depends on the specific problem and the impact of the regularization parameter."
