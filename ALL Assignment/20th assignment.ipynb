    "\n",
    "Ans . Get and Post methods are the HTTP request methods used inside the <form> tag to send form data to the server. HTTP protocol enables the communication between the client and the server where a browser can be the client, and an application running on a computer system that hosts your website can be the server."

    "\n",
    "Ans . Flask redirect is defined as a function or utility in Flask which allows developers to redirect users to a specified URL and assign a specified status code. When this function is called, a response object is returned, and the redirection happens to the target location with the status code. When a website is visited, server receives a request and after processing responds to the request with a three-digit code known as the HTTP code. In a programming world this status code that is returned as a response is known as Errors. Errors and redirect function goes hand in hand.\n",

Flask uses the Jinja template library to render templates. In your application, you will use templates to render HTML which will display in the user's browser.\n",
