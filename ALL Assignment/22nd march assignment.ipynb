    "Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose\n",
    "you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam\n",
    "scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you would need a dataset that includes the values for both variables for each student. Let's assume you have a dataset with the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amount of time spent studying (in hours):\n",
    "X = [10, 8, 6, 7, 5, 4, 6, 3, 7, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Final exam scores:\n",
    "Y = [90, 88, 76, 78, 82, 80, 85, 75, 84, 92]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient (often denoted as \"r\") can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = (Σ[(X_i - X̄)(Y_i - Ȳ)]) / sqrt(Σ(X_i - X̄)^2 * Σ(Y_i - Ȳ)^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- X_i and Y_i are the individual values of the two variables (amount of time spent studying and final exam scores) in the dataset.\n",
    "- X̄ and Ȳ are the means (averages) of the two variables, calculated as X̄ = ΣX / n and Ȳ = ΣY / n, where n is the number of data points.\n",
    "- Σ denotes the sum of the values in the parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in the values from the dataset, we can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "X̄ = (10 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 9) / 10 = 6.5\n",
    "Ȳ = (90 + 88 + 76 + 78 + 82 + 80 + 85 + 75 + 84 + 92) / 10 = 83.6\n",
    "\n",
    "Σ[(X_i - X̄)(Y_i - Ȳ)] = (10-6.5)(90-83.6) + (8-6.5)(88-83.6) + ... + (9-6.5)(92-83.6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Σ(X_i - X̄)^2 = (10-6.5)^2 + (8-6.5)^2 + ... + (9-6.5)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Σ(Y_i - Ȳ)^2 = (90-83.6)^2 + (88-83.6)^2 + ... + (92-83.6)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in the values and calculating, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "Σ[(X_i - X̄)(Y_i - Ȳ)] = -15.3\n",
    "Σ(X_i - X̄)^2 = 57.5\n",
    "Σ(Y_i - Ȳ)^2 = 389.44\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can plug these values into the formula for r:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = (-15.3) / sqrt(57.5 * 389.44) ≈ -0.64\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is -0.64, which indicates a negative linear relationship between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores. A negative value for r indicates that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the final exam scores tend to decrease, and vice versa. The magnitude of -0.64 suggests a moderate negative correlation, meaning that the two variables are moderately related, but not perfectly linearly related."

    "variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To calculate Spearman's rank correlation between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level, you would need to have data for both variables from a sample of individuals. Once you have the data, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Rank the data\n",
    "Rank the data for both variables separately. Assign ranks to each observation based on their values, with the lowest value getting a rank of 1, the next lowest getting a rank of 2, and so on. If there are ties (i.e., two or more observations with the same value), you can assign them the average rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Calculate the difference in ranks\n",
    "For each observation, calculate the difference in ranks between the two variables. Subtract the rank of sleep amount from the rank of job satisfaction for each observation.\n",

    "Plug the sum of squared differences calculated in Step 4 into the Spearman's rank correlation formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) = 1 - (6 * sum of squared differences) / (n * (n^2 - 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "where n is the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Interpret the result\n",
    "The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) ranges from -1 to 1. A positive value of rho indicates a positive monotonic relationship, meaning that as the amount of sleep increases, job satisfaction tends to increase as well. A negative value of rho indicates a negative monotonic relationship, meaning that as the amount of sleep increases, job satisfaction tends to decrease. A rho value of 0 indicates no monotonic relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship. A coefficient close to 1 or -1 indicates a strong monotonic relationship, while a coefficient close to 0 indicates a weak or no monotonic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, after calculating the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level, you can interpret the result to determine the direction and strength of the monotonic relationship between the two variables."
