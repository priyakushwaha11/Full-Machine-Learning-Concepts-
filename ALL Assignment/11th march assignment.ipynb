    "A z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known, or when the sample size is sufficiently large (typically n ≥ 30) that the sample standard deviation can be assumed to be a good estimate of the population standard deviation. It is appropriate for continuous data that are normally distributed or approximately so. \n",

    "In statistics, a hypothesis test is a way of making decisions based on data about whether a particular hypothesis is true or not. The null hypothesis is the statement that is being tested, while the alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. There are two types of hypothesis tests: one-tailed tests and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-tailed test is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis specifies the direction of the effect. That is, the alternative hypothesis predicts that the observed effect will be either greater than or less than a certain value, but not both. For example, a one-tailed test could be used to determine whether a new drug reduces blood pressure (one-tailed test for a decrease) or whether a new marketing campaign increases sales (one-tailed test for an increase).\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-tailed test is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis does not specify the direction of the effect. That is, the alternative hypothesis predicts that the observed effect will be different from a certain value, either greater than or less than that value. For example, a two-tailed test could be used to determine whether a new drug affects blood pressure (two-tailed test for any change) or whether a new marketing campaign affects sales (two-tailed test for any change).\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a one-tailed or two-tailed test depends on the specific research question and the nature of the effect being studied. A one-tailed test is more powerful than a two-tailed test, meaning that it is more likely to detect a true effect if one exists. However, it is also more prone to type I errors (false positives) if the direction of the effect is not correctly specified. A two-tailed test is more conservative and less prone to type I errors, but it is also less powerful than a one-tailed test."

    "Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes the relationship between conditional probabilities. It provides a way to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or information.\n",

    "\n",
    "To illustrate the theorem, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a test for a rare disease, which affects only 1% of the population. The test has a 95% accuracy rate, meaning that it correctly identifies 95% of people with the disease and 5% of people without the disease will be false positives. \n",

It is a range of values within which we can be confident that the true population parameter lies, given a certain level of confidence. For example, if we say that a certain parameter has a 95% confidence interval of (0.4, 0.6), we mean that if we repeated the sampling process many times and constructed 95% confidence intervals from each sample, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true value of the parameter.\n",

The formula for calculating a confidence interval depends on the sample statistic and the sampling distribution.
