    "\n",
    "Ans.App Routing means mapping the URLs to a specific function that will handle the logic for that URL. Modern web frameworks use more meaningful URLs to help users remember the URLs and make navigation simpler. Example: In our application, the URL (“/”) is associated with the root URL\n",
    "\n",
    " Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on). In simple terms, Routing allows targeting different routes or different URLs on our page."
