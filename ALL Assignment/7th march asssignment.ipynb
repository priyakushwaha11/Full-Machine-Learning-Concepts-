It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean, divided by the total number of data points minus one. A higher variance indicates that the data is more spread out from the mean.\n",

    "An example of how these measures of dispersion can be used is if you were analyzing the heights of students in a class. The range would tell you the difference between the tallest and shortest student. The variance and standard deviation would give you an idea of how much variation there is in height among the students. If the standard deviation was high, it would indicate that there is a wide range of heights among the students."

    "\n",
    "Covariance and correlation are two statistical measures that are used to describe the relationship between two variables. \n",

    "Covariance is a measure of how much two variables change together. It is calculated by taking the product of the difference between each variable and its mean, and then averaging those products. Covariance can be positive, negative, or zero. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that one variable tends to increase while the other decreases. A covariance of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the variables.\n",

    "Correlation, on the other hand, measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

    "Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  the impact of outliers on measures of central tendency and dispersion. Central tendency refers to the typical or average value in a set of data, while dispersion refers to how spread out the data is. Outliers are values that are significantly different from the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When outliers are present in a data set, they can greatly affect measures of central tendency. For example, if a set of test scores has one extremely high score, the mean (average) score will be skewed higher than the typical score. This can give a misleading impression of the overall performance of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can also affect measures of dispersion. For example, if a set of salaries has one extremely high salary, the range (difference between the highest and lowest salaries) will be much larger than it would be without the outlier. This can make it difficult to accurately compare the salaries of different groups or individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, outliers can have a significant impact on statistical analysis and should be carefully considered when interpreting data."
