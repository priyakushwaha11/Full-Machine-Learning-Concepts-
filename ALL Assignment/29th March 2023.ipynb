    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Lasso Regression, or L1 regularization, is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term based on the \n",
    "    absolute values of the coefficients to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. This penalty term helps\n",
    "    in regularizing the model by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "    The main difference from other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression, is the type of penalty applied: \n",
    "        Lasso uses L1 penalty, while Ridge uses L2 penalty.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it tends to produce sparse models by \n",
    "    setting some coefficients to exactly zero. This means that Lasso can automatically select a subset of relevant\n",
    "    features, leading to a more interpretable and efficient model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Q3. The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model can be interpreted in terms of feature importance. A non-zero\n",
    "    coefficient indicates the importance of the corresponding feature in predicting the target variable. Coefficients\n",
    "    that are exactly zero imply that the associated features have been excluded from the model. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the\n",
    "model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  In Lasso Regression, the tuning parameter is usually denoted as lambda (Î»). It controls the strength of the\n",
    "    regularization penalty. As lambda increases, more coefficients are pushed towards zero, leading to increased \n",
    "    sparsity in the model. The tuning parameter can be adjusted to find the right balance between model simplicity and\n",
    "    predictive performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique and may not handle non-linear relationships between\n",
    "    features and the target variable well. However, it can be used for non-linear regression problems by incorporating\n",
    "    non-linear transformations of the input features or by combining it with non-linear modeling techniques.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of penalty applied. Ridge \n",
    "    Regression uses an L2 penalty, which penalizes the squared values of the coefficients, while Lasso uses an \n",
    "    L1 penalty, penalizing the absolute values of the coefficients. The L1 penalty tends to produce sparse models\n",
    "    with some coefficients exactly zero, making Lasso useful for feature selection.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity to some extent. The L1 penalty tends to select one feature \n",
    "    among a group of highly correlated features, effectively ignoring the others. This can be advantageous in \n",
    "    situations where multicollinearity might be present, as it automatically chooses a subset of features.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression is typically chosen through\n",
    "    cross-validation. By training the model on different subsets of the data and evaluating its performance, one can \n",
    "    identify the lambda value that provides the best balance between model simplicity and predictive accuracy. \n",
    "    Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, are commonly used for this purpose."
