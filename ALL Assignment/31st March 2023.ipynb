    "\n",
    "ANS: Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a machine learning model using historical data on Algerian forest fires.\n",
    "Expose the model through an API (e.g., RESTful API) for integration.\n",
    "Implement frontend logic to interact with the API and send/receive data.\n",
    "Display the model predictions or relevant information on the user interface.\n",
    "APIs or Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or scikit-learn for model development.\n",
    "Flask or Django can be employed to create a RESTful API.\n",
