    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Ridge Regression: Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that includes a regularization term\n",
    "        (L2 regularization) in the cost function. The regularization term is the sum of squared magnitudes of \n",
    "        coefficients multiplied by a tuning parameter (lambda). The objective is to penalize large coefficients, \n",
    "        preventing overfitting and improving the model's generalization performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Ridge Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "It assumes that the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) are normally distributed.\n",
    "Assumption of homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "Independence of residuals: The residuals should be independent of each other.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q3. How do you select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The value of lambda is often chosen through techniques like cross-validation. The goal is to select the value that\n",
    "    minimizes prediction error while also preventing overfitting.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Yes, Ridge Regression can shrink the coefficients of less important features towards zero. While it doesn't \n",
    "    exactly perform feature selection (i.e., setting some coefficients exactly to zero), it effectively downweights\n",
    "    less important features. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. How does the Ridge Regression model perform in the presence of multicollinearity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Ridge Regression is effective in handling multicollinearity. It introduces a penalty term that prevents the model \n",
    "    from relying too heavily on any single variable, reducing the impact of multicollinearity on coefficient estimates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. Can Ridge Regression handle both categorical and continuous independent variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Yes, Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent \n",
    "    variables. For categorical variables, they are typically converted into dummy variables before applying Ridge \n",
    "    Regression.\n",
